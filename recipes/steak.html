    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here’s how to cook steak like a chef – pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter! It’s dramatic, simple cooking at its best, you’ll look like a total pro and feel like you’re dining at the best steakhouse in town…..</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 – 2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot – you should see smoke!</li>
        <li>Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.</li>
        <li>Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme. <strong>BE CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter!</strong></li>
        <li>Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it’s cooked to your liking – 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness temps)<br>Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more.</li>
        <li> Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed Potatoes.</li>
